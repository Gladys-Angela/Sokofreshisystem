# Admin Functionality Implementation

## Core Admin Features Added

### User Management
- **Add Users**: Admins can add new users with specified roles (customer, vendor, admin)
- **Edit Users**: Admins can change user roles
- **Delete Users**: Admins can remove users from the system
- **View Users**: Admins can view user details

### Vendor Management
- **Approve Vendors**: Admins can approve pending vendor applications
- **Reject Vendors**: Admins can reject vendor applications
- **View Vendors**: Admins can view vendor details

## Implementation Details

### Modal System
- Dynamic creation of modals for adding and editing users
- Clean modal styling with proper animations
- Modal closing via X button, Cancel button, or clicking outside

### Notification System
- Success notifications (green) for successful operations
- Error notifications (red) for failed operations
- Warning notifications (yellow) for cautionary actions
- Auto-dismissing notifications after 3 seconds

### Data Management
- Uses localStorage to store user roles and information
- Integrates with Firebase Authentication for user creation
- Real-time updates to the UI after actions are performed

## How to Use

### Adding a User
1. Click the "Add User" button in the Users page
2. Fill in the email, select a role, and provide a password
3. Click "Add User" to create the user

### Editing a User
1. Click the "Edit" button next to a user in the table
2. Change the role as needed
3. Click "Save Changes" to update the user

### Deleting a User
1. Click the "Delete" button next to a user in the table
2. Confirm the deletion in the confirmation dialog

### Managing Vendors
1. Review pending vendors in the "Pending Vendor Approvals" section
2. Click "Approve" to approve a vendor or "Reject" to reject them
3. View all approved vendors in the "All Vendors" section

## Security Considerations
- Only users with the admin role can access admin pages
- Admin actions are protected by the role guard
- Critical operations (like deletion) require confirmation
