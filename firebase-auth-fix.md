# Firebase Authentication Fix

## Issues Fixed
1. "Invalid email or password" error during login
2. "firebase.firestore is not a function" error during registration
3. Firebase version compatibility issues

## Changes Made
1. Updated Firebase SDK versions from 10.12.2/10.11.0 to 9.6.10 (more stable version)
2. Added proper error handling for Firestore initialization
3. Added debugging logs to help identify issues
4. Created a test page (firebase-test.html) to verify Firebase functionality

## Files Updated
- login.html
- register_customer.html
- register_vendor.html
- index.html
- customer_dashboard.html
- vendor_dashboard.html
- direct-login.js
- direct-register.js
- role-guard.js
- migrate-user-roles.js

## How to Test
1. Open firebase-test.html to verify Firebase functionality
2. Click "Test Firebase Initialization" to check if Firebase is properly initialized
3. Register a new user to test authentication and Firestore
4. Login with the new user to verify authentication works
5. Test Firestore read/write functionality

## Next Steps
If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify Firebase project settings in Firebase console
3. Ensure your Firebase project allows email/password authentication
4. Check Firestore rules to ensure they allow read/write operations
