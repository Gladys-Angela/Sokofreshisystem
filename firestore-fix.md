# Firebase Firestore Fix

## Issue Fixed
- Fixed "firebase.firestore is not a function" error during registration
- Added proper Firestore SDK imports to all authentication pages
- Added error handling for Firestore initialization

## Changes Made
1. Added Firestore SDK to:
   - register_customer.html
   - register_vendor.html
   - login.html

2. Added error handling in:
   - direct-register.js
   - direct-login.js
   - role-guard.js
   - migrate-user-roles.js

## How to Test
1. Register as a new customer
2. Log out and try to log in as a vendor with the same email (should fail)
3. Log in as a customer (should succeed)
4. Register as a new vendor with a different email
5. Log out and try to log in as a customer with that email (should fail)
6. Log in as a vendor (should succeed)
