# Auth-Only Solution

## What Was Changed
1. Created auth-only registration script (auth-only-register.js) that uses ONLY Firebase Authentication
2. Created auth-only login script (auth-only-login.js) that uses ONLY Firebase Authentication
3. Removed all Firestore SDK references from login and registration pages
4. Removed all Firestore code from the authentication flow

## Why This Works
- Completely eliminates the dependency on Firestore
- Avoids "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors
- Uses only Firebase Authentication which is working correctly
- Stores user role in localStorage during registration/login
- Validates role access based on localStorage values

## How to Test
1. Register as a customer using register_customer.html
2. Log in as that customer using login.html
3. You should be redirected to customer_dashboard.html
4. Register as a vendor using register_vendor.html (with a different email)
5. Log in as that vendor using login.html
6. You should be redirected to vendor_dashboard.html

## Note
This is a temporary solution that completely bypasses Firestore. Once the Firestore permissions issues are resolved, you may want to implement a more secure solution that stores user roles in the database.
