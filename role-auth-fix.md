# Role-Based Authentication Fix

## What was fixed

The authentication system has been updated to properly separate vendor and customer roles. Previously, users could log in as either a vendor or customer regardless of how they registered. Now:

1. When users register, their role (vendor or customer) is stored in Firestore
2. During login, the system validates that the selected role matches the role stored in Firestore
3. If a user tries to log in with the wrong role, they will receive an error message
4. Dashboard pages are protected with role-based access control

## Technical Changes

1. **Registration Process**:
   - User roles are now stored in Firestore in a 'users' collection
   - Each user document contains email, role, and creation timestamp

2. **Login Process**:
   - The login system now validates the selected role against the role stored in Firestore
   - If there's a mismatch, the user is signed out and shown an error message

3. **Dashboard Protection**:
   - Added role-guard.js to protect dashboard pages
   - Redirects users to the appropriate dashboard based on their role

4. **Migration Script**:
   - Added migrate-user-roles.js to help existing users by adding their roles to Firestore
   - This runs automatically when users visit the site
